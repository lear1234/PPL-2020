1) Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
 ->BB 3 and 4 correspond to the while loop.
->gimple of if -else executes only once while gimple of while checks the condition
and if its true then goes to block of while statements and then after executing them again 
check the condition and keeps on executing the block of statements till the condition is true.


2)   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
