1)  How is array declaration and initialization handled?
1. Arrays is declared in a single statement with no initialisation and explicit
   size. 
Initialisation takes place one element per statement .

2)Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?
->because a[i] = b[i] is like *(a+i)=*(b+i)
hence this operation is broken into 2 parts _1=*(b+i) and *(a+i)=_1 for simplicity

3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
