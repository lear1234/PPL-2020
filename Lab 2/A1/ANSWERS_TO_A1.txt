 1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

A1)For the variables those are single line declarations , in gimple they look same as 
that of the declaration in c file.
For multiple variables declared on the same line they are converted to single line declarations.
The global declaration of int Z is not visible in gimple.



2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
A2)First on one line result of a*b is stored in a variable and then that result is
added with 25 to get the value of the given expression.
In gimple , each expression is broken into small parts , and on each line the
small expression with single operand is solved and by combining the result of such small 
operations ,a  given expression is solved in gimple.



3)   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
A3)Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation like    
	34.5 reprensented as 3.45e+1   in  gimple.  
Float values integer part is taken using (int) type casting.
And this value is then assigned to the int variable.



4)   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
