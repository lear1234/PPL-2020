 1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

->If-blocks are turned into conditional gotos. They are converted to 2 goto blocks
one for the condition to be true and other for condition to be false
Unconditiona gotos are goto by themselves on a line.  



2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.
->Yes , this new representation makes it more easy to understand gimple
